# Python-Challenge

PyBank

Since the PyBank_starter.py file already had the steps annotated on there, I just decided to copy the format and keep it as a guide to show you how and why I wrote the code that I did.

I then moved the CSV file from the Starter_Code file to the folder in my repository, so It was a little simpler to path to.

I did use Xpert Learning Assistant (XLA) for help with initializing the date values, because I was having an issue with it, but after assigning it as an empty string to a variable (ie. ="") it worked great.

    greatest_increase_date = ""  # Initialize this variable
    greatest_decrease_date = ""  # Initialize this variable

PyPoll

I essentially did the same thing for this assignment that I did for the PyBank one. I copied the format from the Starter_Code file and began entering in each line to explain what the code was doing
I did add some additional lines for formatting changes.
